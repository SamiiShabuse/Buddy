Question: What should the extraction process look like?

# Option 1:
Use generative ai read text and bucket tasks accrodingly.

## Pros:
- Low complexity
- Easy to setup
- Works with abstract text
## Cons:
- Expensive especially when scaling up
- Potentially unreliable

# Option 2:
Use zero-shot-classifcation to categorize text, and then based on category parse tasks through various unique means

## Pros:
- Lower costs especially when scaling
- More control and fine tuning
## Cons:
