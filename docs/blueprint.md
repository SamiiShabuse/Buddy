Got it! Since most tasks will be **auto-generated** from sources like calendars, emails, and notes, your system needs **smart task extraction and categorization**. Let’s refine the **task flow** so it aligns with that automation-first approach.

---

## **Updated Task Flow (Automation-First)**
Your system should:
1. **Extract** tasks from user sources (calendars, emails, notes).  
2. **Categorize** them automatically (`user_category` and `task_type`).  
3. **Prioritize & Schedule** tasks intelligently.  
4. **Notify & Adapt** based on user behavior.  

### **Step 1: Task Extraction (NLP Processing)**
Your AI should scan **structured & unstructured data** to extract tasks.

| **Source** | **Example** | **Extracted Task** |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Calendar** | “Meeting with Prof. Lee at 2 PM” | 🏫 `School` → `Reminder` |
| **Email** | “Your assignment is due Friday” | 🏫 `School` → `Deadline-Based Task` |
| **Notes** | “Need to buy groceries” | 🏠 `Personal` → `Basic Task` |

---

### **Step 2: Auto-Categorization**
Your system will **assign two labels**:
1. **`user_category`** → Defines *what area of life the task belongs to* (e.g., Work, School, Personal).  
2. **`task_type`** → Defines *how the system should automate it* (e.g., Reminder, Deadline-Based Task).  

| **Extracted Task** | **User Category** | **Task Type** |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| “Finish math homework by Friday” | `School` | `Deadline-Based Task` |
| “Buy milk after work” | `Personal` | `Basic Task` |
| “Doctor’s appointment at 3 PM” | `Health` | `Reminder` |
| “Weekly team meeting” | `Work` | `Recurring Task` |

---

### **Step 3: Task Storage & Scheduling**
Once categorized, tasks will be:
- **Stored in the database** with their `user_category` and `task_type`.
- **Scheduled** based on:
  - Due dates (for `deadline_based_task`).
  - Optimal time slots (for `ai_suggested_task`).
  - Recurring rules (for `recurring_task`).

---

### **Step 4: Smart Notifications & Adjustments**
Your AI will **actively manage** tasks based on user behavior.

| **Scenario** | **System Response** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| User **completes** a task early | Mark as ✅ Completed |
| User **misses** a task | Reschedule OR escalate reminder |
| New urgent email detected | Create a **high-priority task** |
| User repeatedly reschedules | Suggest **AI time optimization** |

---

## **Final Task Block (Auto-Generated)**
Since the user **isn’t manually adding tasks**, your system will **auto-populate** this JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "name": "Submit Homework",
  "user_category": "School",
  "task_type": "deadline_based_task",
  "source": "Email",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "time-based",
    "datetime": "2025-02-02T18:00:00Z"
  },
  "execution_details": {
    "notification_type": "push",
    "message": "Reminder: Submit your homework!"
  },
  "editable_fields": ["trigger", "execution_details"],
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

---

## **Why This Works for Your MVP**
✅ **Fully Automated** – Tasks are **extracted, categorized, and scheduled** automatically.  
✅ **User-Friendly** – Users don’t have to manually enter tasks—just **connect their data sources**.  
✅ **AI-Powered Adjustments** – The system **adapts schedules dynamically** based on behavior.

## **Next Steps for Your MVP**
1. **Build a Task Extraction Pipeline** (NLP to pull tasks from notes, emails, and calendars).  
2. **Implement Auto-Categorization** (Map `user_category` + `task_type`).  
3. **Set Up Task Execution Rules** (Reminders, Rescheduling, Priority Adjustments).
